#Tic-Tac-Toe
A visually appealing game of tic-tac-toe. Names are optional, the bot unbeatable.

#TODO
- Vendor prefixes: transition css, transitionend js, animation css, flexbox, etc.


#Small issues
- radio button bottom gets cut off on hover

#What could be done better
- `justify-content: center` and add margins on the vs element and set the width of the inputs with `ch` or `ex` units to space evenly. This way a transition can be made to move the player & opponents closer to the vs sign for better visual effects.
- animate scoreboard changes (push away old values)
